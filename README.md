# hackathon
Thingy for documatics hackathon. 

I am very new to NPM packages so this is my first one!
I hope it is something useful/good! <!--Probably not-->

<!-- - I am not allowed to publish the package for the Hackathon
## How to install
Run this command
```
$ npm install @raadsel/smallify
```
-->

## How to use

You can use the `log` function as a replacement for console.log
```js
const log = require("@raadsel/smallify");

log("Hello world!")
//=> "Hello world!"
```
